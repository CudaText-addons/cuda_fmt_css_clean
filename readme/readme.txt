Ported from Sublime Text plugin:

  CleanCSS indents all your rules properly, aligns all the values by the colon,
  and sorts each property into categories within each rule:
  * Imports (for LESS)
  * Variables (for LESS)
  * Mixins (for LESS)
  * Content
  * Positional
  * Dimensional
  * Appearance
  * Animation
